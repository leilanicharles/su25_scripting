variable: userInput,compPick;
variable: userTry=7;


generate a random number from 1-100 and hold that variable as compPick;
	
	print: "guess a number from 1-100";

every wrong guess the variable userTry will decrease by one;

	print:"enter your guess:" userInput;

and take that input as userInput

while userTry is grater than 0 then ;

	print: "attempts left" userTry "out of 7";

if userTry reaches 0 ;
	
	print: "you lost try again?";

if userInput is equal to compPick then;
	
	print: "you win play again?";

return to beginning;
